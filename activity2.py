##Activity 2. repetitions over lists
# Define a simple list
simple_list = ['a', 'b', 'c']
# Use the repetition operator to make three copies of the list and join them together
repeated_list = simple_list * 3
# Print the new list created by the repetition operator
print("Repeated list:", repeated_list)
# Iterate over the repeated list using a for loop and print each element
for element in repeated_list:
    print(element)
